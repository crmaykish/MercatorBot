#MercatorBot
---

MercatorBot is my exploration and environment-mapping robot. Ultimately, it will be able to perform the following tasks autonomously:
- Explore and map indoors and out
- Orient itself using relative and absolute positioning techniques
- Path of least resistance analysis and pathfinding

These are all stretch goals at the moment. More details will be hammered out as I find and build the hardware and software components required to make this work.
